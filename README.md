This project analyzes soil properties such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall to provide actionable insights for farmers.
It predicts the most suitable crop using a machine learning model trained on agricultural datasets.
The system also recommends fertilizer plans by comparing current soil nutrient levels with ideal crop-specific requirements.
Users can input real-time soil parameters through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
The project aims to support smart farming decisions and improve crop productivity using data-driven approaches.
